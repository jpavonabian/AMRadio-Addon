# Amateur Radio Add-on for NVDA

## Description
**Amateur Radio Add-on** is an Add-on for the NVDA screen reader that provides tools for amateur radio enthusiasts. This add-on includes a three-minute timer with audio notifications and a feature to quickly look up callsigns on QRZ.com. It is ideal for users who operate amateur radio while using NVDA and need to manage their transmission times effectively or access callsign information easily.
## Features
- Three-Minute Timer: Helps users manage transmission times. Plays a warning tone at 2 minutes and 40 seconds and a final tone at 3 minutes.
- QRZ Callsign Lookup: Allows users to enter an amateur radio callsign, fetches data from QRZ.com, and displays it in a read-only dialog within NVDA.
## How It Works
- Timer: The timer can be started with a specific gesture. It plays tones at the designated intervals and announces the start of the timer.
- Callsign Lookup: Users can open a dialog to enter a callsign. After submission, the add-on fetches information for that callsign from QRZ.com and displays it in a new read-only dialog. This allows for quick access to callsign details without leaving NVDA.
- UTC time: Users can know the UTC time.
- Open brand meister hoseline: Users can open brand meister hoseline.
## Keyboard Shortcuts
Keyboard shortcuts must be assigned by the user through the "Input gestures" option in NVDA's Preferences menu. Both features are available under the category "AM Radio Add-on."
