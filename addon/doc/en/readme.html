<h1>Amateur Radio Add-on for NVDA</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p><strong>Amateur Radio Add-on</strong> is an Add-on for the NVDA screen reader that provides tools for amateur radio enthusiasts. This add-on includes a three-minute timer with audio notifications and a feature to quickly look up callsigns on QRZ.com. It is ideal for users who operate amateur radio while using NVDA and need to manage their transmission times effectively or access callsign information easily.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Three-Minute Timer: Helps users manage transmission times. Plays a warning tone at 2 minutes and 40 seconds and a final tone at 3 minutes.</li>
<li>QRZ Callsign Lookup: Allows users to enter an amateur radio callsign and navigate directly to the corresponding QRZ.com page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>Timer: The timer can be started with a specific gesture. It plays tones at the designated intervals and announces the start of the timer.</li>
<li>Callsign Lookup: Users can open a dialog to enter a callsign. After submission, they are redirected to the QRZ.com page for that callsign.</li>
<li>UTC time: Users can know the UTC time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
<p>Keyboard shortcuts must be assigned by the user through the "Input gestures" option in NVDA's Preferences menu. Both features are available under the category "AM Radio Add-on."</p>
